# Stake Micron Platform

Staking platform where the user earns Bitci based on the APR defined in the smart contract.

The apr calculation in the contract works as follows:

With the 10% APR, assuming that the user has staked for 1 month and has 100% of the tokens in stake, and in the contract he has 1 Bitici in balance, he will receive 8.25% of the Bitici he has in the contract, or 0.0825 Bitci. Now if he had 50% of all tokens staked, he would receive 50% of that amount, or 0.04125

It will depend on how much Bitci is in the contract, and how many tokens are in the contract staked, but it is currently set to 10% based on the total Bitci in the contract and the total staked

Example, in 1 week, with an apr of 10% and 1 bitici in the contract, assuming that the user has 100% of the staked tokens, it will yield him 0.0192 Bitici.

## Whats is APR?

APR is an Annual Percentage rate, we can change it so that the profitability is 10% per week, but if it is an apr of 10%, as it is annual, it is divided by the other 12 months
